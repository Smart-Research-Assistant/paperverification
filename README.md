# 🚀 Fraud Detection Using AI-Generated Document Analysis

Welcome to the **Fraud Detection** project! This repository hosts a powerful web-based solution to detect whether a document (e.g., research paper, article, or report) has been generated using Artificial Intelligence. The solution combines cutting-edge AI technologies, including **Vector Databases**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, into a sleek and user-friendly interface.

## 🌟 Features

- **Upload PDF Documents:** Simply upload your document via the web interface.
- **AI Detection Engine:** Analyze your document using state-of-the-art NLP techniques.
- **Fast and Accurate Results:** Get a concise "Yes/No" answer with a detailed explanation.
- **Powerful Backend:** Combines embeddings, vector databases, and local AI models for maximum performance and privacy.
- **Completely Open Source:** Explore, contribute, and enhance this repository.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Upload a Document:** Start by uploading a PDF file through the web interface.
2. **Text Extraction:** The document text is extracted and pre-processed.
3. **Vector Search:** Key sections of the document are matched with a pre-built knowledge base using a vector database.
4. **RAG Pipeline:** The system uses a local **Large Language Model (LLM)** to analyze the document.
5. **Detection Result:** The result is displayed directly on the web interface, providing a "Yes" or "No" answer with a short explanation.
